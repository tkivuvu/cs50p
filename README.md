# CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions to problem sets and the final project from Harvard University's CS50P — an introduction to programming using Python.

## 🐍 Course Overview

CS50P focuses on programming fundamentals using Python. Key concepts include:

- Variables, conditionals, and loops
- Functions and scopes
- File I/O and regular expressions
- Data structures (lists, dicts, sets)
- Object-oriented programming
- Unit testing with `pytest`
- Web APIs and JSON
- Command-line interface (CLI) design

## 📁 Project Structure

### Problem Sets

Each problem set focuses on a specific Python concept or challenge. This repository includes:

- `pset0`: Making Faces
- `pset1`: Playback Speed, Deep Thought
- `pset2`: Coke Machine, Math Interpreter
- `pset3`: Grocery List, Fuel Gauge, Taqueria
- `pset4`: Emojize, Adieu, Frank, Guess
- `pset5`: Bank, Refueling, File Extensions
- `pset6`: Lines of Code, Shakespeare Analyzer
- `pset7`: Numble, Working Hours
- `pset8`: Cookie Cutter, Seasons, Response Time

Each folder includes a Python script and (where applicable) test cases written using `pytest`.

### 🏎️ Final Project: F1 History CLI

**Project Title**: *F1 History CLI*  
**Description**: A command-line application that retrieves Formula 1 race and qualifying results using the **Jolpica F1 API**. Built with Python and includes automated tests using `pytest`. The app supports:

- Race results by season and round
- Driver and constructor standings
- Qualifying results
- Team and driver stats

**Technologies**: Python, CLI, API, Pytest
