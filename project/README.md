    #### Description:
    What my program does is relatively straight forward, it is first and foremost powered by a data gathering API that is freely available on the internet named ergast.com. What this API provides is information regarding the history of the most popular motorsport in the world known as Formula 1. The way in which my program works is that it provides various Grand Prix (what a race weekend is called) driver and constructor data which is gathered from this API. The information provided goes as far back as 1950 and ends in current times- with the most recent race updated as it occurs; the API itself is updated in a relatively timely manner each Grand Prix weekend to reflect the most recent race results.

    The first thing I will discuss is my design for the “def main():” function. The way I designed my program is that I wanted the data to be turned into JSON formatted data so that I can use the requests library in order to retrieve the needed information, I also used the sys library in order to allow user inputted data in the form of sys.argv, finally, there are if and elif statements that accompany the sys.argv decision as these statements provide for categorization and hence better clarity as to what info is being researched (for e.g if a user is looking for driver standings they need to type in “DS” in sys.argv[1], if searching for race schedule they would type in “RS” etc..).  Once the needed information for the 5 categories of data collection (driver standings, constructor standings, race schedule, race results, qualifying results) were retrieved I then created a variable where I could store the matching function with the variable for the gathered json formatted data results, finally, I used a for loop which iterates over a list, created through my functions, to print the information. Each function, outside of main(), has the task of creating a list, appending the above gathered data in the best way I saw fit and finally returning as opposed to printing the result so that I don't run into any issues when I do the testing  (this is further explained below when discussing the functions).

    The five different functions provide my program with the five different categories of data collection that is being gathered by my program. The first function named “printDS()” deals with driver standings hence the acronym “DS”, I designed it by first creating a list -- which in my program is called result -- and from this list I then appended some of the gathered information in the best way I saw fit giving the user clarity and a more digestible format of what they are looking for. I give the user information regarding the position of said driver, the name including first and family names, the amount of points they had that season, the driver’s nationality, their date of birth and finally the constructor they drove for that season. Lastly, as alluded to earlier I use the return method to allow my main function to be the one tasked with printing the appended list results, this allows me to not have any issues when testing my program in the code design for test_project.py. For each one of my functions this same design was utilized and even the naming of my variables was very similar  -- with slight differences so for e.g the list that accompanied the driver standings function was called “result” then for constructor standings it was called “result2” and so on and so forth -- so as to have uniformity and avoid confusion when I was working on it.

    Now I will discuss my design choices for the test_project.py program which is the program that tests the main program. For my test program my design was quite straightforward, since all my functions were so similar in design, I created a variable called “test_data” (in different variation e.g “test_data1”) for each function where I stored json formatted data, this data was gathered from the API (ergast.com) through a small program I wrote which downloads -- as json formatted data -- the necessary information that pertains to each one of my functions (so for e.g if I need data to do with driver standings I downloaded a portion of what this looks like in json format). What this means is that I had data -- that I then copied and pasted and stored in the aforementioned test_data variable --  which is a portion that looks exactly like the data my main program generates in the exact same format. The next thing I did was to create another variable this time named “expected_result”, here, I literally copied and pasted what my data looks like when it is printed using one of my functions combined with the specific data being inputted in the variable “test_data”. Finally, the last line of code in all my test functions was to match this data (“expected_result”) using the assert keyword and the == sign with the the function being tested which would include, as an argument to that function, the data gathered in “test_data” this would ensure that the resulting output matches exactly what my program would output should it be required to.
